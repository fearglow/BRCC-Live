== Description ==

### Get notified of file and permission changes on your WordPress sites and boost reliability & security 

Melapress File Monitor is a WordPress file integrity monitoring plugin that keeps track of file and permission changes on your WordPress websites. It enables you to promptly identify code changes, file and directory permission changes, leftover files, malicious code, and malware injections - and take action.

Install [Melapress File Monitor](https://melapress.com/wordpress-file-monitor/?utm_source=wp+repo&utm_medium=repo+link&utm_campaign=wordpress_org&utm_content=mfm) on your website to:
*	Detect malware, infected files or files altered by bad actors
*   Keep track of the last code changes on your website for easier troubleshooting
*	Identify changes in file and directory permissions
*	Identify leftover & backup files that can lead to sensitive business & technical data exposure
*	Spot malware injections early to avoid irreparable site damage
*	Conduct essential WordPress forensic analysis after a cyberattack.

The plugin allows you to monitor and log file and permission changes across your WordPress site. You can see changes directly in the WordPress dashboard for easy access. You can also configure the plugin to send you file and permission change alerts through email whenever it detects a change; keeping you informed wherever you are. 

It helps you easily spot leftover and backup files that could leave your website exposed, and detect malware and code changes, so you can remove the files and clean malware infections at the earliest possible.

### Plugin Features

Melapress File Monitor is a very easy to use plugin with zero admin work. 

#### No False Alarms - Just Genuine Alerts!

This plugin uses an exclusive smart technology that detects WordPress core updates, plugin & theme installs, uninstalls, and updates.

When you update the WordPress core, install a new plugin, update a theme, or delete a plugin it won't flood you with hundreds of alerts prompting a false alarm. You only get alerted of genuine file and permission changes that can have an effect on the functionality and security of your WordPress site!

#### Instant Email Notifications

After a scan, the plugin sends an email with the list of file and permission changes it identifies on your WordPress sites and multisite networks.

The email includes all the details you require to track WordPress file changes, such as:
* The filename and the path of the file
* A count of how many files were added, modified or deleted
* A highlight of the site admin changes that caused the file changes, such as the plugins or themes installs, uninstalls, and updates.

#### Scans ALL Your Files, Including Custom Code

Melapress File Monitor can scan any type of file and it is not limited to WordPress and PHP files. Apart from the WordPress core files, plugins and themes files, it will also scan any other custom code files that you might have on your WordPress site. 

It also compares the WordPress core files of your website to the list of files on the official WordPress repository, so it will also alert you if a WordPress core file has been tampered with, or changed. You can also choose to exclude specific files, directories, and extensions for complete control.

#### WordPress Multisite Networks Support

== Screenshots ==

1. The plugin is very easy to install and configure - follow the install wizard through which you can configure the scan frequency and times, email notification settings, which file extensions to exclude from a scan and other scan details via an easy to follow setup wizard.
