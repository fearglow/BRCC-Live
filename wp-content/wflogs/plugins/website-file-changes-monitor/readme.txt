### Why Do You Need a website file integrity monitoring plugin?

No single WordPress security solution is bullet proof. Every solution has its shortcomings. A complete security solution is made up of a suite of tools and plugins that work together, allowing you to address all of your website's security requirements. The more tools and security layers you build, the harder it will be for attackers to succeed. It also makes it easier for you to block malicious attacks, and monitor the site's security and health.

The Melapress File Monitor plugin provides you with the much needed visibility of modifications that happen on your website's file system. File changes on your WordPress website can be an early sign of a malicious hack attack or a technical problem. Hence why security professionals recommend a website files monitor plugin.

* Identify a possible hack attack during the early stages, allowing you to limit the damage
* Find where exactly backdoors, trojans and other malware are injected on your site

* Catch red-handed the exploitation of 0-day vulnerabilities on your site
* Ease the process of cleaning & recovering an infected hacked website

#### A Role Beyond WordPress Security

The scope of monitoring your website for file changes goes beyond detecting malicious attacks and malware infections. It is a WordPress website security and management best practice that can also help you:

* Check the integrity of your WordPress core files

2. Once the wizard is completed the first time scan starts automatically.
3. In the plugin dashboard you can see the recent list of file changes events, which should give you a good overview of the detected file changes.
4. The plugin's smart technology does not just report file changes. It can detect if a new plugin has been added, updated, or removed, and it reports the details rather than just flagging a file change.
5. The plugin can also detect when new files are added to the core of your website, even if it is not a WordPress or php file.
6. You can use the plugin's search filter to search for specific files and find what you need for in just seconds, in case you have a good number of file changes events.
